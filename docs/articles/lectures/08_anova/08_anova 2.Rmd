# categorical predictors

#### In lecture 5, we learned about fitting models with categorical predictors with 1 (measurement error) or 2 (frog) levels

--

- Linear models with these categorical predictors correspond to one-sample or two-sample *t*-tests

--

- Binary categorical predictors are quite common in ecological studies (e.g., male vs female, juvenile vs adult, disturbed vs undisturbed)

--

#### However, you will often encounter categorical predictors with >2 levels

- What are some examples? 

---
# motivating example

Foresters are studying the effect of 4 different fertilizers (treatments) on the growth of loblolly pine, which are grown on 3 plots (replicates) receiving each treatment. Data are average height per plot after 5 years:

.pull-left[
<br/>
```{r echo = FALSE}
data("loblollydata")
pine_wide <- tidyr::pivot_wider(loblollydata, names_from = Treatment, values_from = Height)

pine_wide %>%
  kable("html", align = 'c') %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("condensed"), 
                full_width = FALSE, font_size = 18) %>%
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Treatment" = 4))
```
]

--

.pull-right[
#### Notation

- The number of groups (treatments) is $\large a=4$

- The number of observations within each group (replicates) is $\large n=3$

- $\large y_{ij}$ denotes the $\large j$th observation from the $\large i$th group
]

# a brief tangent

#### What counts as an observation?

--

#### Experimental unit

> the physical unit that receives a particular treatment

--

#### Observational unit

> the physical unit on which measurements are taken

--

These are not always the same! 

--

Examples

- Agricultural fields given different fertilizer, crop yield measured  

- Rats given different diets, disease state measured

- Microcosm given different predator abundance, tadpole growth measured


---
# motivating example

**Question:** Is there a difference in growth among the four treatment groups?

--
```{r pine1, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
loblollydata$x <- c(0.8, 1, 1.2, 1.8, 2, 2.2, 2.8, 3, 3.2, 3.8, 4, 4.2)
ggplot(loblollydata, aes(x = x, y = Height)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = Treatment), size = 5) +
  scale_x_continuous("Fertilizer treatment", labels = c("A", "B", "C", "D"), breaks = 1:4) +
  scale_y_continuous("Height") +
  guides(color = FALSE)
```

---
# motivating example

#### Hypotheses
- $\large H_0 : \mu_A = \mu_B = \mu_C = \mu_D$

- $\large H_a :$ At least one inequality

--

#### How should we test the null?

--
We could do this using 6 *t*-tests  

<br/>
--
But this would alter the overall (experiment-wise) $\large \alpha$ level because each individual test has a chance (usually $\large \alpha = 0.05$) of incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis, and this is multiplied when multiple tests are used  

---
# extending the linear model

#### Fortunately, extending the previous linear model to include additional predictor levels is "straightforward"

- The model looks familiar

$$\large y_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_ix_{ij} + \epsilon_{ij}$$

$$\large \epsilon_{ij} \sim normal(0, \sigma)$$


--

- What's tricky is how we code $\large x_{ij}$ when it is more than just 0 or 1

--

- Fortunately, what we learned about how `R` codes dummy variables will help

---
# dummy variable coding

```{r echo = TRUE}
data(loblollydata)
loblollydata[c(1,4,7,10),]
```


```{r echo = TRUE}
fit1 <- lm(Height ~ Treatment, data = loblollydata)

model.matrix(fit1)[c(1,4,7,10),]
```

---
# dummy variable coding

```{r echo = TRUE}
model.matrix(fit1)[c(1,4,7,10),]
```

The model matrix has one column for every parameter in the model

- How many parameters is this model estimating?

--

$$\large E[y_{ij}] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 I(B)_{ij} + \beta_2 I(C)_{ij} + \beta_3 I(D)_{ij}$$
where $I(B/C/D)_{ij}$ are dummy variables (0/1 depending on treatment)

--

- What is the interpretation of each parameter?

---
# motivating example

```{r echo = TRUE}
broom::tidy(fit1)
```

--

- Be sure you understand what each parameter means!

--

- *t*-statistics and *p*-values are calculated and interpreted in the same way as the frog example

--

- But wait, the null hypothesis was $\mu_A = \mu_B = \mu_C = \mu_D$

---
# regression f-statistic

.small-code[
```{r echo = TRUE}
summary(fit1)
```
]

---
# regression f-statistic

The *F*-statistic tests whether all regression coefficients (other than the intercept) are all 0

- $H_0$: All regression coefficients are 0

- $H_A$: At least one regression coefficient is not 0

--

*F*-statistics are the ratio of *sample variances*

$$F = \frac{s^2_A}{s^2_B}$$
- Null hypothesis is that population variances are equal ( $\sigma^2_A = \sigma^2_B$ )

- Always positive (variances cannot be negative)

- Usually > 1 (by putting larger variance in the numerator)

--

Where do the variances come from in the linear model and what do they tell us about differences among groups?

---
# regression f-statistic

#### To understand why the test is based on variance, it is helpful to consider several types of means:

--

.pull-left[
- Grand mean

$$\large \bar{y}. = \frac{\sum_i \sum_jy_{ij}}{a \times n}$$
]

.pull-right[
```{r pine_grm, fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
loblollydata$x <- c(0.8, 1, 1.2, 1.8, 2, 2.2, 2.8, 3, 3.2, 3.8, 4, 4.2)
ggplot(loblollydata, aes(x = x, y = Height)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = Treatment), size = 5) +
  scale_x_continuous("Fertilizer treatment", labels = c("A", "B", "C", "D"), breaks = 1:4) +
  scale_y_continuous("Height") +
  guides(color = FALSE) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean(loblollydata$Height)) +
  annotate("text", label = "bar(y)[.]", x = 4.25, y = mean(loblollydata$Height) + 0.6, 
           parse = TRUE, size = 8)

- Group means

$$\large \bar{y}_i = \frac{\sum_j y_{ij}}{n}$$


We can now decompose the observations as

$$\large y_{ij} = \color{#446E9B}{\bar{y}.} + \color{#D47500}{(\bar{y}_i - \bar{y}.)} + \color{#3CB521}{(y_{ij} - \bar{y}_i)}$$

# the additive model

#### The decomposition

$$\Large y_{ij} = \color{#446E9B}{\bar{y}.} + \color{#D47500}{(\bar{y}_i - \bar{y}.)} + \color{#3CB521}{(y_{ij} - \bar{y}_i)}$$
--

#### The additive model

$$\Large y_{ij} = \color{#446E9B}{\mu} + \color{#D47500}{\alpha_i} + \color{#3CB521}{\epsilon_{ij}}$$

--

#### where

$$\Large \epsilon_{ij} \sim normal(0, \sigma^2)$$

---
# the additive model

$$\large y_{ij} = \mu + \alpha_i + \epsilon_{ij}$$

$$\large \epsilon_{ij} \sim normal(0, \sigma^2)$$

#### Notes

- $\large \mu$ is the grand mean of the population, estimated by $\large \bar{y}.$  
  
--

- $\large \alpha_i$ is the effect of treatment *i*, estimated by $\large\bar{y}_i - \bar{y}.$  

--
  + It is the deviation of the group mean from the grand mean  

  + If all $\large\alpha_i = 0$, there is no treatment effect  

  + Thus, we can re-write the null hypothesis $H_0 : \alpha_1 = \alpha_2=... =\alpha_a = 0$  

--

- $\large \epsilon_{ij}$ is the residual error, estimated by $\large y_{ij} - \bar{y}_i$  

  + It is the unexplained (random) deviation of the observation from the group mean

# mean squares

### To covert the sums of squares to variances, divide by the degrees of freedom

--
#### Mean squares among

$$\Large MS_A = \frac{SS_A}{a-1}$$

--
#### Mean squares within

$$\Large MS_W = \frac{SS_W}{a(n-1)}$$

---
# f-statistic

<br/>
<br/>

$$\LARGE F = \frac{MS_A}{MS_W}$$

--

#### Note:

--

- *F* is a ratio measuring the variance among groups to the variance within groups

--

- If there is a large treatment effect, what happens to $MS_A$?

--

- If there is little residual variation, what happens to $MS_W$?

--

- Large values of $F$ indicate treatment effects are large relative to residual variation, but can we conclude there is a treatment effect? 

---
# the f-distribution

#### **If the null hypothesis is true** ( $\sigma^2_A = \sigma^2_B$), the ratio of sample variances follows an *F*-distribution

.pull-left[
#### Properties:  

- $F > 0$  

- $F$-distribution is not symmetrical  

- Shape of distribution depends on an ordered pair of degrees of freedom, $df_A$
and $df_B$

.pull-right[
```{r f, fig.height=4, fig.width=4}

      ylim=c(0,1),
      frame=FALSE , main="F distribution with df1=3 and df2=8", cex.main=1.5)
# xs1 <- seq(qf(.025, 9, 9), 0, by=-0.01)
# ys1 <- df(xs1, 9, 9)
xs2 <- seq(4.2, 10, by=0.01)
ys2 <- df(xs2, 3, 8)
# polygon(c(xs1, rev(xs1)), c(rep(0, length(xs1)), rev(ys1)), col=gray(0.7))
polygon(c(xs2, rev(xs2)), c(rep(0, length(xs2)), rev(ys2)), col=gray(0.7))
# text(xs1[1], 0.9, "critical value\nF=0.25", pos=3)
text(xs2[1], 0.9, "F=4.1 \n p = 0.05", pos=3)
# arrows(xs1[1], 0.9, xs1[1], ys1[1], length=0.1)
arrows(xs2[1], 0.9, xs2[1], ys2[1], length=0.1)
par(op)
```

Just like the *t*-distribution, we can use the *F*-distribution to calculate *p*-values and test the null hypothesis that the variances are equal

---
# analysis of variance

#### Using the *F*-statistic to test whether there is a treatment effect is commonly referred to as *Analysis of Variance* (ANOVA)

--

- Especially in experimental settings, ANOVA is very commonly used  

--

- The linear model approach is increasingly common, especially in observational settings

--

- From a practical standpoint, the linear model and ANOVA approaches provide exactly the same information, just presented in different ways (just like the linear model vs t-test we saw previously)

# summary

1) Models with categorical variables can be fit using either `lm()` or `aov()`

--

2) The test traditionally known as *ANOVA* is just an extension of the linear model used analyze a binary predictor variable

--

3) `R` codes categorical predictors using dummy variables and `lm` coefficients correspond to the difference between the reference level and the other treatment levels

--

4) `lm()` or `aov()` provide the exact same information, just presented in different ways

--

5) ANOVA output commonly used for manipulative experiments, linear model output for observational studies

--

6) But how do we tell which groups differ from each other (aside from just the reference level)...
