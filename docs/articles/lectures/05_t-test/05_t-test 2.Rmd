# context, part 1

#### We are interested in whether a certain brand of scale provides accurate mass measurements

--

Hypothesis

> Measurement error, measured as the difference between the mass indicated by the scale and the true mass of an object, is 0 (on average)

--

```{r fig.height=4, fig.width=6}
measure_df <- data.frame(z = seq(from = -1, to = 1, by = 0.01),
                         pr_z = dnorm(x = seq(from = -1, to = 1, by = 0.01), 0, 0.2))

ggplot() + 
  geom_path(data = measure_df, aes(x = z, y = pr_z), color = "#446E9B") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) +
  scale_y_continuous("Density") +
  scale_x_continuous("Measurement error", expand = c(0, 0))
```

---
# context, part 1

Field procedure:

- randomly sample 10 scales of the same make and model

- weigh a test object (of known mass) on each scale and record the difference between the measured and true mass 


--

Data:

`-0.062, -0.38, 0.85, -0.58,  0.53,  0.09,  0.31,  0.77,  0.59,  -0.17`

```{r fig.height=4, fig.width=6}
samp <- data.frame(y = c(-0.062, -0.38, 0.85, -0.58,  0.53,  0.09,  0.31,  0.77,  0.59,  -0.17))

ggplot() + 
  geom_path(data = measure_df, aes(x = z, y = pr_z), color = "#446E9B") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) +
  geom_rug(data = samp, aes(x = y), color = "#D47500") +
  scale_y_continuous("Density") +
  scale_x_continuous("Measurement error", expand = c(0, 0))
```

---
# the linear model

$$\LARGE y_i = \beta_0 + \epsilon_i$$

$$\LARGE \epsilon_i \sim normal(0, \sigma)$$

--

- $\large \beta_0$ is the expected (or average) measurement error across all scales

- $\epsilon_i$ is residual error associated with each measurement

--

- This is most simple linear model we can construct

--

- If our hypothesis is correct, $\large \beta_0 = 0$

--

- Question: What is the value of $\large \beta_0$ if our hypothesis is wrong?

# the linear model

#### Because this is a linear model, we can fit it using the `lm` function:

```{r echo = TRUE}
fit1 <- lm(y ~ 1)

broom::tidy(fit1)
```


--

- The `(Intercept)` estimate corresponds to $\large \beta_0$ and is simply the mean value of $\large y$

--

- The standard error is calculated simply as $\large \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$
--

- We will discuss whether there is evidence that $\beta_0 \neq 0$ in the next lecture

---
# the linear model as a t-test

#### The model we just fit has a corresponding "test" that you may encounter: the *one-sample t-test*

.pull-left[
- One-sample t-tests are used to test whether the mean of a population differs from some value (in this case 0)

- there is a built-in function to fit t-tests

- the mean (and the SE, t-statistic, p-value, confidence interval) are exactly the same in both approaches
]

.pull-right[

```{r echo = TRUE}
t.test(y, mu = 0)
```
]

---
# the one-sample t-test by hand

#### Because this is such a simple model, we can calculate $\large \beta_0$ and the standard error by hand very easily

```{r echo = TRUE}
(beta0 <- mean(y))
(SE <- sd(y)/sqrt(10))
```

--

Again, we will discuss how to use this information to determine whether $\large \beta_0$ is or is not equal to 0 in the next lecture

#### When $\large x = 0$:

- $\large E[y] = \beta_0$

- What is the interpretation of $\large \beta_0$?

# fitting the model in `R`

To interpret this output, we need to know how `R` codes categorical predictors...

---
# categorical predictors in `R`

#### When you include a categorical predictor (factor or character object) in your model, `R` recodes it is a **dummy variable**

- For a predictor with two levels, one level gets coded as $\large 0$ and the other as $\large 1$

- For unordered factors or character objects, levels are determined by alphabetical order

- For ordered factors, levels are determined by factor levels

fit2 <- lm(Frogs ~ Development, data = frogdata)

broom::tidy(fit2)
```

--

- The `(Intercept)` estimate ( $\beta_0$ ) is the expected number of frogs in a low-development plot

--

- The `DevelopmentHigh` estimate ( $\beta_1$ ) is the *difference* between low-development and high-development plots

--

- **Question**: Are there fewer frogs in high-development plots?

# fitting the model by hand

In this case, we can also fit the model "by hand"

--

The parameter estimates are:

```{r echo = TRUE}
mu_high <- mean(frogdata$Frogs[frogdata$Development == "High"])
mu_low <- mean(frogdata$Frogs[frogdata$Development == "Low"])

(beta_0.hat <- mu_low)
(beta_1.hat <- mu_high - mu_low)
```

--

How do we calculate the standard errors?

---
# fitting the model by hand

How do we calculate the standard errors?

--

Because we have samples from two populations (low and high development), we have to use the *pooled* variance of both samples to calculate the correct standard errors:

$$\large s^2_p = \frac{(n_L − 1)s^2_L + (n_H − 1)s^2_H}{n_L + n_H − 2}$$

--

```{r}
var_low <- var(frogdata$Frogs[frogdata$Development == "Low"])
var_high <- var(frogdata$Frogs[frogdata$Development == "High"])

# Pooled variance
(s2.p <- (9*var_low + 9*var_high)/18)
```

---
# fitting the model by hand

How do we calculate the standard errors?

--

With the pooled variance calculated, we can calculate the standard errors. For the intercept:

$$\large SE_{\beta_0} = \sqrt{\frac{s^2_p}{n_L}}$$

```{r}
(SE_beta0 <- sqrt(s2.p/10))
```

--

For the slope:

$$\large SE_{\beta_1} = \sqrt{\frac{s^2_p}{n_L} + \frac{s^2_p}{n_H}}$$

```{r}
(SE_beta1 <- sqrt(s2.p/10 + s2.p/10))
```

--

What is the interpretation of these standard errors?


---
# the linear model as a t-test

#### As before, the model we just fit has a corresponding "test" that you may encounter: the *two-sample t-test*

.small-code[
```{r echo = TRUE}
t.test(Frogs ~ Development, data = frogdata)
```
]

- Used to test whether the means of two population are different

- Results are exactly the same as `lm`

---
# other ways to fit the model

#### By default, the linear model approach provides the mean of the reference group and the difference in the group means

--
- This version of the linear model formulation is usually referred to as the *effects parameterization*

- We can easily calculate the mean of group 2 from the linear model as $\beta_0 + \beta_1$

--

- We can also recode the model in `R` to provide the group means (the *means parameterization*)

```{r echo = TRUE}
fit3 <- lm(Frogs ~ Development - 1, data = frogdata)
broom::tidy(fit3)
```


---
# summary

- The simplest linear model we can construct tests whether the mean of a sample is different from some null value (usually 0)

    + This model is the same as a one-sample t-test
    
--

- The same linear model can be extended to test whether the mean of two groups differ from each other

    + The `lm()` function uses dummy variables, i.e., coding one treatment level as 0 and the other as 1
    
    + By default, the intercept is the mean of the reference group and the slope parameter is the difference between the group means
    
    + This model is the same as a two-sample t-test
    
--

- The alternative ways to fit this model (t-test, effects parameterization, means parameterization) provide the *exact same information*

    + In other words, they do not change your conclusions!
