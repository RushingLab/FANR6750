```

## # A tibble: 2 × 5
##   term            estimate std.error statistic       p.value
##   &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;

- The `(Intercept)` estimate ( `\(\beta_0\)` ) is the expected number of frogs in a low-development plot


- The `DevelopmentHigh` estimate ( `\(\beta_1\)` ) is the *difference* between low-development and high-development plots


- **Question**: Are there fewer frogs in high-development plots?

---

#### **Question**: Are there fewer frogs in high-development plots?

- This question is harder to answer than it might seem. Why?

--

#### Sampling error!

--

- If we did the experiment again, we'd get a different difference (maybe even a change in direction)

--

- The sample means will *always* be different (which we will prove shortly)

--

If the sample means will never be the same, we need to re-formulate our question:

- How large of a difference between our samples provides evidence that the population means are different?

# null hypothesis testing

---
# null hypothesis testing

#### How can we express our question about development and its impacts on frogs as a hypothesis?

--

If development does not influence frog abundance, `\(\beta_1 = 0\)`

- This is called the *null hypothesis* (i.e., no effect)

- Denoted `\(H_0\)`

--

If development does influence frog abundance, `\(\beta_1 \neq 0\)`

- This is the *alternative hypothesis*

- Denoted `\(H_a\)`

--

- Note that we could make the alternative more specific and say development negatively effects abundance ( `\(\beta_0 &lt; 0\)` )

---
# null hypothesis testing

#### Remember that `\(\large \beta_1\)` is a **population** parameter

- We estimate population parameters from samples

--

#### What is our best estimate of `\(\large \beta_1\)`? 

--

 - The difference in sample means: `\(\hat{\beta}_1 = \hat{\mu}_{Low} - \hat{\mu}_{High}\)`
 
--

- For the frog data:


```r
mu_high &lt;- mean(frogdata$Frogs[frogdata$Development == "High"])
mu_low &lt;- mean(frogdata$Frogs[frogdata$Development == "Low"])

(beta_1.hat &lt;- mu_high - mu_low)
```

```
## [1] -13.1
```

Note that this is same as the estimate of `\(\beta_1\)` provided by the `lm` and `t-test` functions

---
# null hypothesis testing

#### Our estimate of `\(\large \beta_1\)` is clearly not `\(\large 0\)` but does that imply that the null hypothesis is wrong?

--

- Not necessarily! Why?

--

- Sampling error! Even if `\(\beta_1 = 0\)`, `\(\hat{\beta}_1\)` will *never* equal 0

--

Enter *null hypothesis testing*:

&gt; formal approach to deciding whether a statistical relationship in a sample reflects a real relationship in the population or is just due to chance 


---
# null hypothesis testing

#### NHT is based on the *expectation* of what our data should look like **if the null hypothesis is true**

--

- If our data look really different than what we expect **if the null hypothesis is true**, then it is unlikely that the null hypothesis is true and we reject `\(H_0\)`

--

- It's important to note that there is *always* a chance that our results are simply due to chance 

--

#### Type I error (i.e., false positive rate)

- The probability that we will reject `\(H_0\)` when it is actually true

- Usually denoted `\(\alpha\)`

- Generally, `\(\alpha = 0.05\)` or `\(\alpha = 0.01\)` are accepted Type I error rates

---
# null hypothesis testing

#### How do we know what the data should look like **if the null hypothesis is true**?

--

- Again, we can use theory to tell us about long-term expectations (similar to the sampling distribution)

--

- But maybe easier to understand using simulation

---
# simulating data under the null hypothesis

#### Imagine the null hypothesis is true in the measurement error example (i.e., measurement error = 0)

- Any difference between the sample mean and 0 is just due to sampling error

--

- We can simulate a "sample" in `R` using the `rnorm()` function


```r
y &lt;- rnorm(n = 10, mean = 0, sd = 1)

mean(y) - 0
```

```
## [1] -0.0719
```


--

Note that the we fixed the mean of the normal distribution to be 0, so we know the null hypothesis is true

---
# simulating data under the null hypothesis

Instead of just taking the difference `\(\bar{y} - 0\)`, we can standardize the differences by dividing by the standard error:


```r
se.y &lt;- sd(y)/sqrt(10)
(mean(y) - 0)/se.y
```

```
## [1] -0.2194
```

--

- This tells us how many standard errors away from 0 the sample mean is 

- We'll call this value `\(t\)`

`$$\large t = \frac{\bar{y} - 0}{SE_y}$$`


---
# simulating data under the null hypothesis

#### Generate and plot 1000 sample means:


```r
t &lt;- numeric(length = 1000)

for(i in 1:1000){
  y &lt;-  rnorm(10, mean = 0, sd = 1)
  t[i] &lt;- mean(y)/(sd(y)/sqrt(10))
}
```

# simulating data under the null hypothesis

&lt;img src="05_nht_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="432" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

#### Note that:

--
1. The null hypothesis was true for every sample

--

2. Some sample means were bigger than expected, some were smaller (all due to sampling error!)

--

3. The resulting distribution looks *kind of* normal

---
## THE *t*-DISTRIBUTION

The distribution of the *t*-statistics is not quite normally distributed

--

Instead, theory says that the *t*-statistics will follow a `\(t\)`-distribution with `\(n - 1\)` degrees of freedom (**if the null hypothesis is true**!)

&lt;img src="05_nht_files/figure-html/t-1.png" width="576" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
## THE *t*-DISTRIBUTION

#### More about the *t*-distribution

--

- Continuous probability distribution

--

- Symmetrical with mean = 0

--

- More mass in the tails as degrees of freedom get smaller (i.e., more extreme values become more likely)


--

- For sample sizes `\(n \gt 30\)`, the `\(t\)`-distribution is essentially a standard normal distribution with mean = 0 and SD = 1

--

- Published by William Sealy Gosset in 1908 under the pseudonym "Student". Gosset worked for Guinness and was interested in quality control of beer ingredients 

---
# null hypothesis testing

#### Quick review:

--

1. The null hypothesis `\(\large H_0\)` is that there is no effect or no difference

--

2. The *t*-statistic measures the difference between the sample mean and its hypothesized value (under the null) relative to its standard error 

--

3. **If the null hypothesis is true**, the *t*-statistics from repeated samples follow a *t*-distribution with `\(\large n-1\)` degrees of freedom

--

Importantly, because we can quantify properties of the *t*-distribution, we can compare the *t*-statistic calculated from our observed sample to the expected values under the null hypothesis

--
- If our observed *t*-statistic would be unlikely under the null hypothesis, we can conclude that the null hypothesis is false

--

- This is the logic behind null hypothesis testing

---
# null hypothesis testing

# null hypothesis testing

#### Is there evidence to reject `\(\large H_0\)`?

&lt;img src="05_nht_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="432" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# null hypothesis testing

#### Measurement error example


```r
y &lt;- c(-0.062, -0.38, 0.85, -0.58,  0.53,  0.09,  0.31,  0.77,  0.59,  -0.17)

(mean.y &lt;- mean(y))
```

```
## [1] 0.1948
```

```r
(se.y &lt;- sd(y)/sqrt(10))
```

```
## [1] 0.1557
```

```r
(t.stat &lt;- mean.y / se.y)
```

```
## [1] 1.251
```

--

#### Is there evidence to reject `\(\large H_0\)`?

---
# null hypothesis testing

#### Measurement error example


&lt;img src="05_nht_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="432" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Approximately 18% of the simulated values of `\(t\)` are larger than 1.25 (or smaller than -1.25)

- Put another way, **if the null hypothesis is true**, there is about a 1 in 5 chance of observing `\(t \geq 1.25\)` 

---
# null hypothesis testing

In reality, we don't need to simulate the distribution of `\(t\)` every time we do an experiment

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="05_nht_files/figure-html/p-1.png" width="360" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

- Easy (in `R`) to calculate the area of grey shaded regions, which is the probability of getting a value `\(t\)` larger in magnitude than 1.251 **if the null hypothesis true**

--

- This is called a *p*-value

--

- In our example, `\(p = 0.174\)`. Would you reject the null?

---
# more on *p*-values

#### The *p* -value tells you how likely your observations (or more extreme) would be **if the null hypothesis is true**  

--

#### A *p* -value does not tell us how much evidence there is in favor of a particular difference in means

--

#### What factors result in a small *p* -value?

--

- The sample mean is far from 0

- And/or the SE is small

---
# *p*-values and type i error

#### In NHST, our conclusion must be to either reject or "fail to reject" the null hypothesis

--

#### When we reject the null hypothesis, there is always a chance that we do so mistakenly

- Due to sampling error, there is always a chance we get a large value of *t* even if the null hypothesis is true

- These "false positive" mistakes are referred to as *Type I error* (denoted `\(\alpha\)`)

--

#### The probability of type I error is measured by the *p*-value

--

#### Generally, we want to avoid false positive conclusions. Why?

--

- Type I error rates of `\(\lt 5\)`% or `\(\lt 1\)`% are generally considered reasonable


---
# critical values

#### Before statistical software made it easy to calculate *p*-values, researchers would look up *critical values*

- For a given sample size (degrees of freedom) and `\(\alpha\)`, what is the associated value of *t*

- If your calculated *t* is `\(\geq\)` the critical value, reject the null hypothesis

&lt;img src="05_nht_files/figure-html/cv-1.png" width="432" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

# frog example

#### Back to the frog example


```r
data(frogdata)

fit2 &lt;- lm(Frogs ~ Development, data = frogdata)

broom::tidy(fit2)
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 × 5
##   term            estimate std.error statistic       p.value
##   &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 (Intercept)         19.2      1.87     10.3  0.00000000573
## 2 DevelopmentHigh    -13.1      2.64     -4.97 0.000100
```

--

Now we're ready to interpret the rest of this output

---
# nhst for regression parameters

#### It turns out, regression parameters also follow a *t*-distribution **if the null hypothesis is true**

--

#### In a regression context:

`$$\large t = \frac{\hat{\beta}_1 - \beta_1}{SE(\hat{\beta}_1)}$$`

--

#### For the frog example:


```r
beta1.hat &lt;- mu_high - mu_low
(t &lt;- (beta1.hat - 0)/2.64)
```

```
## [1] -4.962
```

---
# nhst for regression parameters


```r
broom::tidy(fit2)
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 × 5
##   term            estimate std.error statistic       p.value
##   &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 (Intercept)         19.2      1.87     10.3  0.00000000573
## 2 DevelopmentHigh    -13.1      2.64     -4.97 0.000100
```

Notice that the `lm` output provides a *t*-statistic and *p*-value for both the slope coefficient and the intercept

- How do we interpret the intercept *p*-value? 

- Is the *p*-value for the intercept biologically meaningful?


---
# nhst for t-tests

As we saw before, the frog model can be fit as a two-sample *t*-test


```r
t.test(Frogs ~ Development, data = frogdata)
```

```
## 
## 	Welch Two Sample t-test
## 
## data:  Frogs by Development
## t = 5, df = 18, p-value = 1e-04
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group Low and group High is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##   7.554 18.646
## sample estimates:
##  mean in group Low mean in group High 
##               19.2                6.1
```

--

Notice that the *t*-statistic and *p*-value is the same as the `lm` model
