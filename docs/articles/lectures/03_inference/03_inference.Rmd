### Statistics = Information + Uncertainty

#### In the last lecture, we learned that models allow us to quantify relationships between variables based on **samples**

--

#### We also learned that sampling = uncertainty

- Parameter estimates from samples will never exactly equal population parameters

--

#### Inference about populations requires quantifying the magnitude of this uncertainty

--

#### But how can we measure how far our estimates are from the population parameters if we don't know the population parameters? 

---
# parameters vs statistics

### Parameters 

- Attributes of the population  
  + Mean ( $\mu$ )  
  + Variance ( $\sigma^2$ )  
  + Standard deviation ( $\sigma$ )  

--
- Usually unknown  

--
- Parameters are the quantities of interest  

--

### Statistics

- Attributes of the sample  
  + Mean ( $\bar{y}$ or $\hat{\mu}$ )  
  + Variance ( $s^2$ or $\hat{\sigma}^2$ )  
  + Standard deviation ( $s$ or $\hat{\sigma}$ )  

--
- Often treated as estimates of parameters

---
# sampling error

#### Question: What is the probablity that $\large \bar{y} = \mu$?

--

- Answer: 0 (why?)

--

#### Fact: The sample mean will never equal the population mean

--

- The difference between $\large \bar{y}$ and $\large \mu$ is **sampling error** 

--

- Sampling error can be reduced but it cannot be eliminated

--

#### Problem: If we don't know $\large \mu$, how do we know how far our estimate is from the true value?

--
- Answer: We don't (for any specific sample)

--
- BUT...we do know how far, on average, a sample of size $n$ will be from the true value

This might seem academic but it is hugely important

- given sufficient sample size ( $\sim n > 30$ ), we *know* the sampling distribution will be normally distributed without needing to repeat the experiment

- although we never know the true population mean $\mu$, we can estimate how far (on average) our sample mean is likely to be away from it (that's what the standard deviation is!)

- the CLT will hold true regardless of whether the source population is normal! 

- [Demonstration using simulations](http://www.ltcconline.net/greenl/java/Statistics/clt/cltsimulation.html)

# standard error

#### The standard deviation of the sampling distribution is called the **standard error of the mean** (or just the standard error)

$$\Large SE =\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$$
- Standard error tells us how far (on average) our sample mean is likely to be from the population mean

- It is the key to estimating uncertainty in our estimates

- Smaller is better


---
class:inverse

# descriptive vs inferential statistics 

> The sample standard deviation ( $s$ ) is a descriptive statistic  

$$\Large s = \sqrt{s^2}$$

- $\large s$ tells us how far, on average, each observation $\large y$ is from the sample mean $\large \bar{y}$

<br/>
--

> The standard error (SE) is an inferential statistic  

$$\Large SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$$
- $\large SE$ tells us how far, on average, each sample mean $\large \bar{y}$ is from the population mean $\large \mu$


---
# quick review

1) sampling is a stochastic process 

- sample statistics (mean, standard deviation) will vary from sample to sample

--

2) the sampling distribution is an (imaginary) collection of statistics from repeated samples of the same population

- assumes that the procedure for generating samples (e.g., sample size) is identical

--

3) Standard error is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution

- $\large SE =  s/\sqrt{n}$

- measures how far, on average, sample statistics are from the true population value (smaller is better!)

--

#### We will explore these concepts in lab, using `R` to generate and visualize repeated samples, calculate properties of the sampling distribution

# calculating confidence intervals

95% of a normal distribution falls between -1.96 and 1.96 standard deviation of the mean<sup>1</sup>

.footnote[[1] Can easily be calculated for other percentages using `R`]

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=3}
ggplot(NULL, aes(c(-3,3))) +
  geom_area(stat = "function", fun = dnorm, fill = "grey80", xlim = c(-3, 3)) +
  geom_area(stat = "function", fun = dnorm, fill = "#446E9B", 
            xlim = c(-1.96, 1.96), alpha = 0.75) +
  scale_x_continuous("", breaks = c(-1.96, 0, 1.96),
                     labels = c(expression(-1.96 * sigma), 
                                expression(mu), 
                                expression(1.96 * sigma))) +
  scale_y_continuous("Density") 
```

--

Question - if this is the sampling distribution, what is the standard deviation? What is our estimate of the mean?

--

95% CI = $\large \bar{y} \pm 1.96 \times SE$





---
# confidence intervals

#### What a confidence interval is **NOT**:

- "there is an $x$% probability that the true population parameter is inside this interval" 

--

#### The true population value is considered a *fixed* parameter

--

#### Before we collect our sample, the ends of the confidence intervals are considered *random variables* (i.e., their value will change each time we collect a sample)

-  Like all random variables, we can describe the long-term (i.e., asymptotic) expectations of confidence intervals if we repeated the experiment many times

--

#### After we collect our sample, the confidence interval either *does* or *does not* contain the true population value

---
# confidence intervals

.pull-left[

Think of confidence intervals like trying to determine where the stake is in a game of horseshoes by looking at where the horseshoes landed 

- The true parameter (i.e., the stake) does not move

- Each horseshoe is the CI based on a single sample (i.e., one throw) 

- Before a horseshoe is thrown, there is some probability it will land around the stake

- After it is thrown, it is either around the stake or not

or...

# confidence intervals

I like to think of confidence intervals as providing a range of values that, based on our sample, are consistent with the population mean (*plausible interval*?)

- If want to be more confident that the CI contains the parameter (e.g., 50% CI vs 95% CI), what happens to the size of the interval?

--

It's worth remembering that 1 - $x$% of the time, the confidence interval we calculate from our sample **will not** include the true population mean. 

```{r ci2, fig.width=7, fig.height=2.5}
ggplot(samp, aes(x = Experiment, y = Estimate)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = LCI, ymax = UCI, color = Coverage), width = 0) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Coverage)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("red", "black")) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 70, color = "red", linetype = "longdash") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "", limits = c(68, 73), breaks = seq(from = 68, to = 72)) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 100)) +
  theme_classic() +
  geom_segment(aes(y = 72.75, yend = 72.75, x = 1, xend = 12), 
               color = "red", linetype = "longdash") +
  annotate(x = 15, y = 72.75, label = "True parameter value", geom = "text", hjust = 0) +
  geom_point(aes(y = 72.25, x = 6)) +
  annotate(x = 15, y = 72.25, label = "Sample mean and 95% confidence interval", geom = "text", hjust = 0) 

```

Of course, with our real data, we have no way of knowing if our sample is one of the black points on this graph `r ji("grinning face")` or one of the red dots `r ji("crying face")`

# for thought

#### If our goal is generally to decrease uncertainty in parameter estimates:

--
- What factors determine the magnitude of our uncertainty estimates (SE or confidence intervals)?

<br/>

--
- What can we, as researchers, control when we design experiments to minimize uncertainty? What can we not control?
