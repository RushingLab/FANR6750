# labs

**Meet weekly**

--

- You should have registered for one and only one lab section

--

- Always attend your assigned lab section unless both TA's have provided prior approval to attend the other section

--

**Taught in R**

--

- No prior experience required

--

- But those without prior experience may need to spend time learning outside of class

--

- You can use your own laptop but make sure you have R and RStudio installed prior the first lab<sup>2</sup>

# lab assignments

--

- 8 throughout semester 

--

- Meant to help with:
    + Understanding lecture/lab concepts
    + Implementing statistical procedures in R
    + Interpreting and presenting results
    
--

- Worth 10 points each
    + Grade based on turning in **complete** assignment **on time**
    + Answer keys will be posted after all assignments have been submitted

---
# grading

#### 200 points total

--

- 3 lecture exams, 40 points (20%) each

    + In-class format using eLC/Lockdown Browser<sup>3</sup>
    + Primarily focused on concepts, not coding
    + Pool of 8-10 potential questions provided in advance
    + Exam consists of 2 questions chosen by me, 2 questions chosen by student
    + Not (explicitly) cumulative
    + See schedule for approximate dates (subject to change)

.footnote[[3] Remote students must take exams during class period in an approved setting]

--

- 8 lab assignments, 10 points (5%) each

---
# a note on ai

AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) have advanced very rapidly in a very short time  

--
- AI can increasingly help answer questions about statistical concepts, coding, etc.  

--

AI = resource (similar to Google, Cross Validated, etc.)  

- AI can help you perform statistical analyses but **it cannot replace your own statistical knowledge**  

--

My goal is not to fight AI, but instead focus on responsible and appropriate use   

- Students may use AI to assist with lab assignments but must acknowledge, document, and assess all AI use  

- Students may use AI to assist with exam preparation but must complete exams without the use of AI

- Unacknowledged use of AI will be considered a violation of course policy. Suspected violations will be referred to the Office of Academic Honesty

---
# a note on ai

Later in the semester, we will have a class discussion on the role of AI in research/statistical analysis

--

In preparation for that discussion, I highly recommend reading [Bull$&!t Machines](https://thebullshitmachines.com/table-of-contents/index.html), a short, self-paced course on the LLM

# remote students

Although we do our best to make instruction and materials accessible to remote students, *this is not officially a hybrid class*. That has several implications:

- Teaching to in-person and remote students is hard, especially labs. Technology problems are inevitable  

- Remote students should be prepared to spend extra effort engaging with course materials if they   

- Remote students must arrange to take exams with a proctor present and exam arrangements must be approved by the instructor prior to the exam

- MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THE PRIMARY eLC PAGE!

--

**A note to in-person students:**  

In my experience, lab and lecture attendance are strong predictors of performance. Although zoom links can be used for brief or unanticipated absences, students based in Athens should attend classes in person

---
# course objectives

**To understand:**  
<br/>

--
1) the logical structure of experiments, including the design of manipulative and observational experiments;  
<br/>

--
2) the analysis of such experiments, focusing on linear models;  
<br/>

--
3) the use of models in ecological studies (experimental and observational);  
<br/>


---
# basic structure

--

1) Foundational concepts for statistical inference and experimental design

--

2) Linear model basics

--

3) Null hypothesis significance testing

--

4) Linear model variations for experiments (t-tests, ANOVA, ANCOVA)

--

5) Generalized linear models and model selection

---
# pre- and post-course assessment

Two short quizzes used to assess collective learning outcomes

- Posted under `Quizzes` on eLC

- Require Lockdown Browser extension

- Pre-assessment available until 8/17/2025

--

The assessments do not count towards your grade, but students who complete them will receive extra credit on their final grade

- 2 points for completing pre-assessment

- 2 points for completing post-assessment

- 1 points for completing both assessments (5 points total) 

---
# looking ahead
