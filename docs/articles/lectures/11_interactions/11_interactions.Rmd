# multiple regression

In the last lecture, we learned about fitting and interpreting multiple regression models of the form:

$$\Large y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times X1_i + \beta_2 \times X2_i + \epsilon_i$$
$$\Large \epsilon_i \sim normal(0, \sigma)$$

--

In all of the examples, we treated $X1$ and $X2$ as independent predictors of the response variables $y$

--

Often, however, we expect — or at least want to test — whether the predictors *interact*

--

- Interactions imply that the effect of one predictor depends on the value of the other predictors

--

- Interpreting the output of models with interactions is a common source of confusion 

---

df1 <- dplyr::mutate(df1, lp.x = -2 + 3 * group + 1.2 * X - 0.9 * group * X,
                     lp = -2 + 3 * group + 1.2 * X,
                     eps = rnorm(100))
df1 <- dplyr::mutate(df1, y.x = lp.x + eps,
                     y = lp + eps)

Interactions can also be formally tested

# redstart example

American redstarts (*Setophaga ruticilla*) are migratory birds that spend the winter in the Caribbean and Central America. During the winter, both males and females defend territories, which vary in quality. In early spring, individuals depart the wintering grounds to migrate back to North America.

Researchers in Jamaica used automated telemetry to record the departure time of 30 male and 30 females, with the goal of measuring how territory quality (measured by sampling insect abundance) influences departure timing.

# factorial designs

This design is called a factorial design. 

- Factorial designs have two (or more) treatments

--

- Because there are 2 levels of predation and 3 levels of food supplementation, this is a $\large 2 \times 3$ factorial design  

--

- The treatment variables are called **factors** or main effects, and the different treatments within factors are called **levels**  

--

- To test for interactions, there must be replication for each combination of factors. Replication of each combination of factors differs from blocking designs

--

- It helps (though is not strictly necessary) for the replication to be balanced, i.e. the same number of replicates for each combination of factors



---
# more on interactions

#### If an interaction is significant, then the effect of one factor depends on the other factor  

- Always test the highest order interaction first, then lower level interactions, then main effects

--

#### Thus, if an interaction is significant, then usually it is ill-advised to further investigate main effects alone (such as with multiple comparison procedures) without taking the other factor into account  

--

#### The way that you do this is to perform a multiple comparison test for one factor at each level of the other factor, and vice versa  

--

#### This is easily performed in `R` as we will see in lab

# interactions between continuous predictors

Chuck-will's-widow are nocturnal birds of high conservation concern. To improve the design of monitoring surveys, researchers are interested in how call rate is influenced by moon phase and cloud cover.

# interpreting interactions

Notice that the interpretation of the "main effects" $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ changes when there is an interaction in the model:

--

- main effects measure the effect of one predictor **when the other predictor is 0**

--

- because interactions change the meaning of the main effects, **you cannot** directly compare "main effect" estimates from models with and without interactions


--

Centering and standarizing predictors 

--

- in many cases, a value of 0 for a predictor is not meaningful (e.g., height), in which case centering the predictors can make interpretation of the main effects more intuitive (e.g., change caused by $X1$ when $X2$ is at its mean)

--

- if predictors are on very different scales (e.g., cm vs kg), it can also help to standardize the predictors (subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation)

---
# additional considerations

--

Always test the highest order interaction first, then lower level interactions, then main effects

--

If you include an interaction term, **always** include the main effects as well regardless of whether they are significant

--

Although we only looked at two-way interactions, it's possible to have higher order interactions. However, interpretation gets very difficult (and increasingly meaningless)

- as models become more complex, you should generally avoid higher-order interactions unless you specifically hypothesize they may be important
