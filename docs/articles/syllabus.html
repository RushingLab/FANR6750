<p>All lab activities for this course will rely heavily on the
statistical programming language <code>R</code>. During the first few
weeks, each lab session will begin with a tutorial on these tools so
students are not expected to be experts prior to the course. However, we
will quickly move into activities that require some degree of
<code>R</code> proficiency so I highly recommend that you have a basic
understanding of programming in <code>R</code> (e.g.,
importing/exporting &amp; manipulating data objects, visualizing data)
prior to this course. If you find yourself struggling with any aspects
of using <code>R</code>, please seek individual help during office
hours. The earlier we can get you up to speed, the more painless the
remainder of the semester will be.</p>

<p>The components of a scientific study need to be considered together
rather than separately; design and analysis aspects will be completely
blended in this course. Emphasis will be on application, and will
include instruction on the use of the <code>R</code> statistical
software. Important points will be reinforced by readings from the
scientific literature and by discussions. Homework assignments and exams
are intended to keep the material fresh in the students’ minds. The
syllabus is subject to change, but the order of material is correct.</p>

<p>Lecture material will largely be based on:</p>
<p><strong>Fieberg, J. (2024). Statistics for Ecologists: A Frequentist
and Bayesian Treatment of Modern Regression Models. An open-source
online textbook.</strong></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><strong>Quinn, G.P. &amp; Keough, M.J. 2002. Experimental Design and

<p>The Fieberg (2024) textbook can be accessed <a href="https://statistics4ecologists-v3.netlify.app/" class="external-link">here</a>.
Purchasing the Quinn (2002) textbook is not required but may be helpful
for clarifying some concepts. A pdf of the book can be downloaded <a href="https://www2.ib.unicamp.br/profs/fsantos/apostilas/Quinn%20&amp;%20Keough.pdf" class="external-link">here</a>.</p>
<p>Additional readings will come from a variety of sources, including
other textbooks and scientific journals, and will be posted on eLC.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="software">Software<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#software"></a>
</h3>
<p>All lab computers will have <code>R</code> and <code>RStudio</code>
installed on them so students are not required to install software on
their own computers. However, students are free to use their own laptops
during lab and having <code>R</code> and <code>RStudio</code> installed
will make it easier to complete lab assignments outside of class. Any
students wishing to use their own computers <strong>should have R and
RStudio installed and running prior to the first lab</strong>. Detailed
instructions for installing <code>R</code> and <code>RStudio</code> can
be found <a href="http://stat545.com/block000_r-rstudio-install.html" class="external-link">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you plan to use your own computer, <strong>be sure you have the
most recent versions of both software programs installed</strong>. This
will greatly decrease the chances of running into issues running the
code I will provide in lab. Prior to the start of the semester, test
that you have <code>R</code> and <code>RStudio</code> installed
correctly by doing the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Launch <code>RStudio</code></p></li>
<li><p>Put the cursor in the window labeled <code>Console</code>. Type
the following code followed by enter or return:
<code>x &lt;- 2 * 4</code>. Next type <code>x</code> followed by enter
or return. You should see the value <code>8</code> print to screen. If
yes, you’ve succeeded in installing R and RStudio.</p></li>

<h2 id="course-policy-on-generative-ai">COURSE POLICY ON GENERATIVE AI<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#course-policy-on-generative-ai"></a>
</h2>
<p>Focus on this course is on the conceptual basis of modern
experimental design and statistical inference, with the primary
objective of providing students with the skills and confidence to
design, conduct, and report the statistical analyses needed to conduct
their own research. For many students, this is the only statistics class
they will take in graduate school. For others, this class is only the
beginning of progression towards more advanced statistical analyses. In
either case, my goal is to provide a firm foundation for conducting and
evaluating scientific research.</p>
<p>One of the core philosophies of this course is that there is no
one-size-fits-all approach to experimental design and statistical
inference. There is no recipe book that students can follow when
conducting research and there will often be multiple ways to approach
experimental design and data analyses. Successful research therefore
requires combining ecological knowledge with thoughtful application of
statistical methods. In the complex systems within which we work,
critical thinking, domain expertise, and skepticism are paramount.
Developing these skills is why you are in graduate school.</p>
<p>Computers are integral to modern statistical inference, allowing
researchers to perform complex data formatting, modeling, and
visualization tasks that would otherwise be impractical or impossible.
As with other resources (textbooks, message boards, blog posts, etc.),
AI can help make some tasks (e.g., coding) easier or more efficient when
used appropriately. For this reason, the use of AI on homework
assignments is not banned in this class (unless specifically noted in
the instructions). <strong>However, students must document their use of
AI by providing the prompts used and the AI responses for every task for
which AI is used.</strong></p>
<p>Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that AI may <a href="https://thebullshitmachines.com/lesson-11-transforming-education/index.html" class="external-link">harm
intellectual development</a> if used improperly. In particular, there is
a risk that AI <em>replaces</em> learning rather than augmenting the
learning process. Developing research skills, including statistical
analysis, takes practice. Failure, setbacks, and frustration are not
only inevitable, they are critical to learning. In my view, the biggest
risk of generative AI is that it can provide a shortcut to avoid the
short-term challenges associated with learning new concepts or skills.
Although that may seem convenient or even helpful, the long term harm of
using AI to replace <em>learning</em> is detrimental to your development
as a researcher, scholar, and citizen. For this reason, exams are
structured in a way that AI cannot be used. Some homework questions will
also state that AI cannot be used and students are expected to follow
these instructions. <strong>Suspected cases of unacknowledged use of AI
will be treated as violations of the honor code.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="attendance">ATTENDANCE<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#attendance"></a>
</h2>
<p>As graduate students who willingly signed up for this course, I
presume that you are eager to learn the material and are self-motivated
enough to put in the required effort. For this reason, I do not set a
formal attendance policy. However, we will cover a lot of material over
the course of the semester and each topic will build on concepts from
previous weeks. As a result, missing even a few lectures or labs will
make it difficult for you to fully master the learning outcomes
described above. If you know you will be missing any lectures or labs,
please contact me in advance so we can make sure you do not get too far
behind on the material.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="a-note-on-fieldwork">A note on fieldwork<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#a-note-on-fieldwork"></a>
</h4>
<p>I realize that many students have field work obligations during the
semester. If you need to take this course but know in advance that you
will be in the field for a portion of the semester, please let me know
ASAP so we can discuss whether field work will be a barrier to taking
the course or merely an inconvenience. This distinction will mainly be a
function of how long and when you will miss class. If these absences are
relatively few, taking the course may still be an option. I will do my
best to record lectures and make them available via eLC. Students will
still be expected to complete and turn in any assignments they miss. If
you are going to miss too many classes or will be unable to complete the
assignments while you’re in the field, it may be better to take the
class at a time when your field commitments are smaller.</p>
</div>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="grading">GRADING<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#grading"></a>
</h2>
<p>200 total points.</p>
<p>Three exams, 40 points (20%) each. Exams will be completed during
normal lecture periods using eLC/Lockdown Browser. Students must
complete the exams in person during the scheduled exam period, unless
otherwise approved by the instructor at least 1 week before the exam.
Remote students must arrange to take exams with a proctor present and
exam arrangements must be approved by the instructor prior to the exam.
Students will need a laptop with Lockdown Browser installed to complete
the exams.</p>
<p>Exams will primarily be focused on concepts, not coding. At least 1
week prior to the exam, students will be given a pool of 8-10 potential
questions. The exam itself will consist of 2 questions from this list
chosen by the instructor and 2 questions chosen by student. Exam dates
on the <a href="https://rushinglab.github.io/FANR6750/articles/schedule.html" class="external-link">schedule</a>
are approximate and subject to change.</p>
<p>The remaining 80 points (40%) of the grade will come from lab
homework assignments. Homework assignments will build on concepts and
skills that we cover in lecture and lab. Specific objectives and tasks
for each assignment, along with any necessary data, will be provided at
the end of each lab activity. These assignments are meant to ensure that
you understand lecture and lab concepts, provide additional practice
implementing relevant statistical methods in <code>R</code>, and provide
experience interpreting and presenting model output.</p>
<p>Over the course of semester, there will be <strong>8</strong> of
these assignments worth <strong>10 points each</strong>. Each assignment
will be due before class the week after the assignment is posted and
must be prepared as an R Markdown file that include all text, code,
model output, and figures necessary to fully document your work and
conclusions (we will spend the first several labs going over preparation
of reports using R Markdown so, again, no previous experience is
necessary). You will automatically receive 10 points for turning in a
completed lab assignment by the assigned due date. Late assignments will
receive a 1-point deduction for each day late and incomplete assignments
will have points deducted in proportion to the degree of incompleteness
(e.g., if 1/3 of the assignment is incomplete, 2-point deduction). The
remaining points will be based on the correctness of your answers.</p>
<p>All academic work must meet the standards contained in the
University’s academic <a href="https://honesty.uga.edu/" class="external-link">honesty
policy</a>. All students are responsible for informing themselves about
those standards before performing any academic work. The penalties for
academic dishonesty are <a href="https://honesty.uga.edu/Academic-Honesty-Policy/Consequences_for_Honesty_Violations/" class="external-link">severe</a>,
and ignorance is not an acceptable defense.</p>
<p>If you know ahead of time that you will miss an assignment or exam,
please let me know as soon as possible so that we can arrange a make up.
If you do not let me or a TA know ahead of time, missed/late assignments
will lose 10% of the final grade per day that they are late.</p>

<h2 id="pre--and-post-course-assessments">PRE- AND POST-COURSE ASSESSMENTS<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#pre--and-post-course-assessments"></a>
</h2>
<p>In an effort to help track learning outcomes, students are asked to
complete optional pre-course and post-course assessments. Both
assessments can be accessed on eLC during the first week
(pre-assessment) and last week (post-assessment) of the semester. The
assessments are short (~20 questions) and consist primarily of multiple
choice and true/false questions that cover a range of topics from
throughout the semester, plus several self-assessment questions aimed at
gauging students’ experience with statistical methods. Responses to
these assessments do not count towards the final grade and will be only
be used to assess trends in learning outcomes. To incentivize
participation, students will receive 2 bonus points for completing the
pre-assessment, 2 bonus points for completing the post-assessment, and 1
additional bonus point for completing both (5 bonus points total).</p>

</h2>
<p>As a University of Georgia student, you have agreed to abide by the
UGA academic honesty policy. UGA Student Honor code:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will be academically honest in all of my academic work and will not
tolerate academic dishonesty of others</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A Culture of Honesty, the University’s policy and procedures for
handling cases of suspected dishonesty, can be found at <a href="https://honesty.uga.edu/" class="external-link">https://honesty.uga.edu/</a></p>
<p>You are responsible for informing yourself about the university’s
standards before performing any academic work. Lack of knowledge of the
academic honesty policy is not a reasonable explanation for a violation.
Please ask if you have questions related to course assignments and the
academic honesty policy. Any form of possible academic dishonesty will
be reported to the UGA Office of the Vice President for Instruction.</p>
